            <p>
              I recently graduated from BCIT's Computer System Technology
              Diploma program specializing in Web and Mobile Development. Prior
              to starting my journey at BCIT's Computer System Technology
              program, I hold a Bachelor of Commerce in Finance and Economics
              from the University of Toronto and have worked in the finance
              industry in Hong Kong. However, I realize my passion lies in
              programming, building and developing software. I love following
              the latest trend in Technology and applying them in my development
              process. Having spent some time at Realtor.com as a Software
              Engineer Co-op specifically in the Mobile Search team, I have
              gained valuable experience in the industry and have learned a lot
              about both the software development process and Android
              development. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a
              Software Engineer / Mobile Developer / Front End Developer /
              Backend Developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides programming, I enjoy playing soccer, video games,
              following the financial markets, and snowboarding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am open to opportunities in the Greater Vancouver Area, Toronto,
              and Hong Kong. If anyone is interested in hiring me or have
              freelance / contract projects opportunities, please feel free to
              reach me on my Linkedin.
